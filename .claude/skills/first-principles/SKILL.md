# First Principles Thinking

When the user invokes this skill, apply first principles thinking to their problem:

## Process

1. **Identify the Problem Clearly**
   - What exactly are we trying to solve?
   - What constraints are we accepting as given?
   - What assumptions are we making?

2. **Break Down to Fundamentals**
   - What are the basic truths we know for certain?
   - What laws of nature or logic apply?
   - What can't be argued with?

3. **Question Every Assumption**
   - Why do we do it this way?
   - Is this constraint real or artificial?
   - What if we removed this assumption?

4. **Rebuild from Ground Truth**
   - Starting from fundamentals, what's the simplest solution?
   - What's actually necessary vs. traditional?
   - Can we solve it in a completely different way?

## Example Application Areas

- **Cost is "too high"**: What actually costs money? Can we eliminate the expensive part entirely?
- **Performance bottleneck**: What is the physical/logical constraint? Can we route around it?
- **"Industry standard"**: Why does everyone do it this way? Is there a better way no one's tried?
- **Complex system**: What is this actually doing? Can we achieve the same result more simply?

## Output Format

Provide:
1. Current approach and its assumptions
2. Fundamental truths/constraints
3. Questioned assumptions with reasoning
4. Rebuilt solution from first principles
5. Comparison: old vs. new approach
6. Potential obstacles to the new approach

Remember: The goal is not just to optimize the existing solution, but to potentially discover a completely different and better approach.
