- **Smart bypass logic** - Automatically detects and bypasses posts with no analyzable content
- **Analysis status fields** - `analysis_status` ('completed', 'bypassed', 'error') and `analysis_comment` for detailed tracking
- **Bypass reason detection** - Smart content analysis to determine why posts are bypassed ('no_text', 'url_only', 'symbols_only', 'media_only')
- **Helper functions** - `handle_no_text_prediction()` and `_get_bypass_reason()` for bypass handling
- **Complete audit trail** - Every harvested post has a prediction record, ensuring no posts are "lost"

#### Changed
- **Database schema** - Added `analysis_status` and `analysis_comment` fields to `Prediction` model
- **Confidence field** - Made `confidence` nullable for bypassed posts
- **Analysis flow** - Posts are checked for analyzable content before sending to LLM
- **Query logic** - `get_unprocessed_shitposts()` now includes posts with no text for bypass processing
- **Store analysis** - Sets `analysis_status='completed'` for successful analyses

#### Benefits
- **Complete data integrity** - Every harvested post tracked with appropriate status
- **Cost optimization** - No wasted LLM API calls on unanalyzable content
- **Easy debugging** - Can query by status to see what happened to each post

- **New fields**: `analysis_status` (String, default 'pending'), `analysis_comment` (String, nullable)
- **Bypass reasons**: 'no_text', 'url_only', 'symbols_only', 'media_only', 'unanalyzable_content'
- **Impact**: 100% post coverage - every harvested post gets a prediction record

#### Example Results
```
3 posts harvested → 3 prediction records created
├── 2 posts analyzed → status: 'completed', comment: null
└── 1 post bypassed → status: 'bypassed', comment: 'no_text'
```

## [0.4.0] - 2024-09-01

### 🎭 **Enhanced CLI Architecture and Project Branding**

#### Added
- **CLI enhancements for LLM analysis operations** - Comprehensive command-line interface for shitpost analysis
- **Unified mode parameter** - Single `--mode` parameter that mirrors sub-CLI structure exactly
- **Always save analyses** - Removed confidence threshold filtering to preserve all LLM insights for RAG enhancement
- **Enhanced separation of concerns** - Clean orchestration between harvesting and analysis phases

#### Changed
- **`main.py` → `shitpost_alpha.py`** - Renamed main orchestrator to match project namesake for better branding
- **Simplified CLI architecture** - Removed redundant `--harvest-mode` and `--analyze-mode` parameters
- **Unified processing modes** - Single `--mode` parameter applies to both harvesting and analysis
- **Confidence threshold handling** - Now always saves analyses with confidence metadata for future RAG enhancement
- **CLI examples** - Updated all documentation to use new `shitpost_alpha.py` filename

#### Removed
- **`--confidence-threshold` CLI parameter** - No longer needed as all analyses are saved
- **Redundant mode parameters** - Eliminated `--harvest-mode` and `--analyze-mode` in favor of unified `--mode`
- **Confidence filtering** - LLM responses are always saved regardless of confidence score

#### Architecture Improvements
- **Cleaner CLI design** - Mirrors sub-CLI parameter structure exactly
- **Better orchestration** - Sequential execution (harvesting → analysis) with shared parameters
- **RAG-ready storage** - All analyses preserved for future retrieval and enhancement
- **Professional branding** - Project identity strengthened through consistent naming

#### Technical Details
- **Files changed**: 7 files
- **Breaking changes**: File rename (`main.py` → `shitpost_alpha.py`)
- **CLI improvements**: Simplified parameter structure and better user experience
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive updates across all README files

#### Benefits
- **Stronger project identity** with consistent "shitpost-alpha" branding
- **Better user experience** with simplified, intuitive CLI
- **Future-ready architecture** for RAG enhancement and analysis combination
- **Professional appearance** with enterprise-grade naming conventions
- **Cleaner codebase** with unified parameter handling

## [0.3.0] - 2024-09-01

### 🚀 **CLI Enhancement for Truth Social Harvester**

#### Added
- **Multiple harvesting modes** for operational flexibility
  - `incremental`: Default mode for continuous monitoring
  - `backfill`: Full historical data harvesting
  - `range`: Date range harvesting with start/end dates
  - `from-date`: Harvest from specific date onwards
- **Date filtering capabilities** with `--from` and `--to` parameters
- **Harvest limit functionality** with `--limit` parameter
- **Dry-run mode** for testing without database writes
- **Comprehensive CLI help** with examples and usage instructions
- **Enhanced main.py integration** supporting new harvesting parameters

#### Changed
- **Enhanced `TruthSocialShitposts` class** with mode-based harvesting
- **Updated `main.py`** to support new harvesting parameters
- **Improved argument parsing** with proper validation
- **Better error handling** for invalid date ranges and modes

#### New CLI Usage Examples
```bash
# Incremental harvesting (default)
python -m shitposts

# Full historical backfill
python -m shitposts --mode backfill

# Date range harvesting
python -m shitposts --mode range --from 2024-01-01 --to 2024-01-31

# Harvest from specific date onwards
python -m shitposts --mode from-date --from 2024-01-01

# Harvest with limit
python -m shitposts --mode backfill --limit 100

# Resume from specific post ID
python -m shitposts --mode backfill --max-id 114858915682735686

# Dry run mode
python -m shitposts --mode backfill --dry-run
```

#### Enhanced Main.py Integration
```bash
# Run with specific harvesting mode
python main.py --harvest-mode backfill --limit 100

# Run with date range
python main.py --harvest-mode range --from 2024-01-01 --to 2024-01-31

# Run ingestion only with custom harvesting
python main.py --mode ingestion --harvest-mode from-date --from 2024-01-01
```

#### Technical Improvements
- **Maintained backward compatibility** with existing functionality
- **Added proper date parsing** and validation
- **Enhanced logging** for different harvesting modes
- **Improved error handling** for invalid configurations
- **Added progress tracking** for long-running operations

#### Benefits
- **Operational flexibility** for different use cases
- **Better testing capabilities** with dry-run mode
- **Efficient data harvesting** with date filtering
- **Professional CLI interface** with comprehensive help
- **Future-ready architecture** for additional harvesting sources

#### Files Modified
- `shitposts/truth_social_s3_harvester.py` - New S3-based harvester with CLI modes and harvesting strategies
- `shitposts/s3_data_lake.py` - S3 data lake management for raw data storage
- `shitposts/cli.py` - Shared CLI functionality for harvesters
- `shitpost_alpha.py` - Updated to support new harvesting parameters
