# Phase 10: Brand Identity Injection

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Started**: 2026-02-17
**Completed**: 2026-02-17
**PR Title**: style: self-deprecating copy & personality
**Risk Level**: Low
**Estimated Effort**: Small (1-2 hours)
**Dependencies**: Phase 03 (Smart Empty States), Phase 05 (Merge Sections)
**Unlocks**: None (final phase)

### Challenge Round Decisions (2026-02-17)
- Removed dead references: `recent_predictions_header`, `hero_label_prefix`, `hero_label_suffix`, `hero_empty` (hero section removed in Phase 05)
- Added `empty_feed_period` key for actual unified feed empty state at dashboard.py:580
- Renamed `copy.py` → `brand_copy.py` to avoid shadowing Python's stdlib `copy` module
- Kept identical-text COPY keys (centralization is the point)
- Fixed mismatched "before" strings to match actual codebase

## Context

The dashboard is functional but reads like an enterprise BI tool. Every section header ("Analytics", "Performance Metrics", "Signal Feed") could have been auto-generated by a product manager who has never seen the product. The copy has no personality, no self-awareness, and zero chance of going viral.

This is a product that monitors a former president's social media posts and pretends an LLM can predict stock movements from them. The UI should acknowledge the absurdity. It should make visitors think "this is ridiculous, I love it" -- not "this is a Tableau dashboard someone skinned dark."

**The Problem**:
- App title subtitle says "Trading Intelligence Dashboard" -- this is not Goldman Sachs
- Section headers are generic ("Analytics", "Latest Posts", "Recent Predictions")
- Empty states are clinical ("No data available", "No signals match your filters")
- The footer disclaimer is boilerplate ("This is NOT financial advice")
- Nothing about the UI acknowledges that the entire premise is absurd
- Nobody is going to screenshot "Accuracy by Confidence Level" and share it

**The Goal**:
- Every piece of visible copy should make the user smirk
- Empty states should be genuinely entertaining (people stay on the page even when there's no data)
- Section headers should explain what they show AND hint at how ridiculous this is
- The footer should be a punchline, not a legal disclaimer
- Someone seeing this for the first time should immediately want to send the link to a friend

## Tone Guide

### What "Self-Deprecating Ironic" Means for This Product

The voice is an engineer who built something absurd and knows it. Not trying to be professional. Not trying to be edgy. Just... honest about what this is.

**The Voice Is**:
- An engineer who can't believe this works (sometimes)
- Aware that "AI-powered financial analysis of shitposts" is an inherently funny sentence
- Proud of the technical work, embarrassed by the premise
- The kind of person who names their database module `shitvault`

**Good Examples**:
- "Accuracy Over Time (are we getting better at this?)"
- "Total P&L -- simulated, obviously. we're not that irresponsible"
- "No high-confidence signals right now. The shitposter is quiet. Markets are safe."
- "Prediction Performance Deep Dive -- or, How Wrong Are We About {SYMBOL}?"

**Bad Examples (DO NOT do these)**:
- "LMAO we're so dumb!!" -- too try-hard, middle school humor
- "Welcome to the future of finance" -- too sincere, missed the point
- "This is definitely not financial advice wink wink" -- legally problematic
- "Stonks go brrr" -- stale meme humor, trying to be Reddit
- "Our AI overlords have spoken" -- AI hype irony is overplayed
- "To the moon!" -- crypto bro culture, wrong audience

### Where NOT to Be Funny

Some text must remain purely functional. Never inject humor into:

1. **Axis labels and chart legends** -- "Accuracy %" must stay "Accuracy %", not "How Right We Were %"
2. **Data table column headers** -- "Timestamp", "Assets", "Confidence", "Return T7", "Outcome" stay as-is
3. **Accessibility text** -- `className`, `id` attributes, ARIA labels
4. **Error states with technical details** -- "Error: Connection refused" stays literal
5. **Numerical values and formatting** -- "$+1,234", "75%", "+2.5%" stay as-is
6. **Filter dropdown option values** -- "Bullish", "Bearish", "Correct", "Incorrect" stay standard
7. **Navigation link text** -- "Dashboard", "Signals", "Trends", "Performance" stay concise
8. **Badge text** -- "Correct", "Incorrect", "Pending", "New" stay short for scannability
9. **Tooltip hover data in Plotly charts** -- Keep `hovertemplate` strings data-focused

## Detailed Implementation

### Change A: Create Centralized Copy Module

**File**: `shitty_ui/copy.py` (NEW)

This is the single source of truth for all user-facing branded strings. Every piece of copy that gets personality lives here. Non-branded strings (axis labels, column headers, badge text) stay inline in their components.

```python
"""Centralized copy for the Shitpost Alpha dashboard.

All user-facing branded text lives here. This makes it easy to:
- Audit tone consistency across the whole app
- Update copy without digging through component files
- Test that branded strings actually render

DO NOT put functional labels here (axis labels, column headers,
filter options, badge text). Only descriptive/personality copy.

### Change B: Wire Copy Into Header

**File**: `shitty_ui/components/header.py`

#### Step B1: Add import

**Location**: Line 6 (after the `from constants import COLORS` line)

```python
from copy import COPY
```

**Note**: This import uses `copy` as the module name because within `shitty_ui/` the import resolves to `shitty_ui/copy.py`. To avoid collision with Python's stdlib `copy` module, the `sys.path` manipulation in the codebase scopes imports to the `shitty_ui/` directory. If there's any conflict, rename the file to `shitty_ui/brand_copy.py` and update all imports accordingly.

#### Step B2: Replace subtitle text

**Location**: Line 36

Change:
```python
                            html.P(
                                "Trading Intelligence Dashboard",
```

To:
```python
                            html.P(
                                COPY["app_subtitle"],
```

#### Step B3: Replace footer disclaimer

**Location**: Lines 186-187

Change:
```python
                    "Disclaimer: This is NOT financial advice. For entertainment and research purposes only."
```

To:
```python
                    COPY["footer_disclaimer"],
```

#### Step B4: Replace footer source link text

**Location**: Lines 198-199

Change:
```python
                        [html.I(className="fab fa-github me-1"), "View Source"],
```

To:
```python
                        [html.I(className="fab fa-github me-1"), COPY["footer_source_link"]],
```

---

### Change C: Wire Copy Into Dashboard Page

**File**: `shitty_ui/pages/dashboard.py`

#### Step C1: Add import

**Location**: After line 22 (the `from components.controls import ...` line)

```python
from copy import COPY
```

#### Step C2: Replace hero section active label

**Location**: Lines 578-584 (inside `update_dashboard()`, the hero section subtitle)

Change:
```python
                                html.Span(
                                    " - High confidence predictions in last 72h",
                                    style={
                                        "color": COLORS["text_muted"],
                                        "fontSize": "0.8rem",
                                    },
                                ),
```

To:
```python
                                html.Span(
                                    f" - {COPY['hero_label_suffix']}",
                                    style={
                                        "color": COLORS["text_muted"],
                                        "fontSize": "0.8rem",
                                    },
                                ),
```

#### Step C3: Replace hero empty state message

**Location**: Line 609

Change:
```python
                                    "No high-confidence signals in the last 72 hours",
```

To:
```python
                                    COPY["hero_empty"],
```

#### Step C4: Replace KPI card subtitles

**Location**: Lines 639-691 (the four `create_metric_card()` calls)

Replace each subtitle string:

1. **Total Signals** (line 642): `"evaluated predictions"` -> `COPY["kpi_total_signals_subtitle"]`
2. **Accuracy** (line 654): `"correct at 7 days"` -> `COPY["kpi_accuracy_subtitle"]`
3. **Avg 7-Day Return** (line 668): `"mean return per signal"` -> `COPY["kpi_avg_return_subtitle"]`
4. **Total P&L** (line 682): `"simulated $1,000 trades"` -> `COPY["kpi_pnl_subtitle"]`

Example for Total Signals:
```python
                        create_metric_card(
                            COPY["kpi_total_signals_title"],
                            f"{kpis['total_signals']}",
                            COPY["kpi_total_signals_subtitle"],
                            "signal",
                            COLORS["accent"],
                        ),
```

#### Step C5: Replace Analytics section header

**Location**: Lines 119-122

Change:
```python
                            dbc.CardHeader(
                                [
                                    html.I(className="fas fa-chart-line me-2"),
                                    "Analytics",
                                ],
```

To:
```python
                            dbc.CardHeader(
                                [
                                    html.I(className="fas fa-chart-line me-2"),
                                    COPY["analytics_header"],
                                ],
```

#### Step C6: Replace "Latest Posts" header and subtitle

**Location**: Lines 193-207

Change:
```python
                                            dbc.CardHeader(
                                                [
                                                    html.I(
                                                        className="fas fa-rss me-2"
                                                    ),
                                                    "Latest Posts",
                                                    html.Small(
                                                        " - Trump's posts with LLM analysis",
```

To:
```python
                                            dbc.CardHeader(
                                                [
                                                    html.I(
                                                        className="fas fa-rss me-2"
                                                    ),
                                                    COPY["latest_posts_header"],
                                                    html.Small(
                                                        f" - {COPY['latest_posts_subtitle']}",
```

Change:
```python
                                                    "Recent Predictions",

                                            COPY["data_table_header"],
```

#### Step C9: Replace empty state messages in dashboard callback

**Location**: Line 751 -- accuracy chart empty state

Change:
```python
                acc_fig = create_empty_state_chart(

**Note**: Some strings intentionally keep their current text (e.g., "Backtest Results", "Signal Feed", "Performance Summary"). These are already concise section headers where adding humor would hurt scannability. The personality is injected through subtitles and descriptions, not primary labels.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `COPY` dict in `shitty_ui/copy.py` contains all required keys (test validates this)
- [ ] Header subtitle reads "Weaponizing shitposts since 2025", not "Trading Intelligence Dashboard"
- [ ] Footer shows self-aware disclaimer, not boilerplate legal text
- [ ] Dashboard hero empty state says "The shitposter is quiet. Markets are safe. For now."
- [ ] KPI subtitles have personality ("coin flip is 50%", "monopoly money")
- [ ] "Latest Posts" section header says "Latest Shitposts"
- [ ] Signals page subtitle says "Every prediction, including the embarrassing ones"
- [ ] Trends default chart title says "Pick an asset to see how wrong we are"
- [ ] Asset page subtitle says "The Full Damage Report for {SYMBOL}"
- [ ] No humor in: axis labels, data table columns, filter dropdowns, badges, numerical values
- [ ] All existing tests pass: `source venv/bin/activate && pytest shit_tests/shitty_ui/ -v`
- [ ] New tests pass: `source venv/bin/activate && pytest shit_tests/shitty_ui/test_copy.py shit_tests/shitty_ui/test_brand_identity.py -v`
- [ ] Navigation link text unchanged (Dashboard, Signals, Trends, Performance)
- [ ] No import conflicts with Python stdlib `copy` module (verify or rename to `brand_copy.py`)
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated

## What NOT To Do

1. **Do NOT add humor to axis labels, column headers, or data values.** The numbers must be instantly readable. "Accuracy %" is not "How Right We Were %". Data labels are functional, not decorative.

2. **Do NOT change navigation link text.** "Dashboard", "Signals", "Trends", "Performance" are navigation aids, not brand opportunities. Users need to find things, not chuckle at the nav bar.

3. **Do NOT change badge text.** "Correct", "Incorrect", "Pending", "New", "Bullish", "Bearish" must stay short and scannable. These are status indicators, not jokes.

4. **Do NOT use stale meme humor.** No "stonks", "to the moon", "HODL", "brrr", or any phrase that peaked on Reddit in 2021. The humor should be original and specific to this product.

5. **Do NOT make the footer disclaimer legally ambiguous.** It should be funny AND clearly communicate "this is not financial advice." No "wink wink" or "just kidding" that could be construed as minimizing the disclaimer.

6. **Do NOT scatter strings across component files.** Every branded string must live in the `COPY` dict in `copy.py`. If a string needs personality, it goes in `COPY`. If it's functional (axis label, column name), it stays inline.

7. **Do NOT break existing test assertions that check for specific strings.** Some existing tests check for "Next refresh", "Last updated", "5:00", etc. Verify these still pass. If a test checks for "Trading Intelligence Dashboard", that test should be updated (not the copy reverted).

8. **Do NOT rename the `copy.py` file without updating all imports.** If Python's stdlib `copy` module causes import conflicts, rename to `brand_copy.py` and update every `from copy import COPY` to `from brand_copy import COPY`.

## CHANGELOG Entry

```markdown
### Added
- **Brand identity system** -- Centralized `COPY` dictionary in `shitty_ui/copy.py` for all user-facing branded text
- **Self-deprecating copy** -- Replaced generic dashboard text with personality-driven copy that acknowledges the absurdity of the product
  - Header: "Weaponizing shitposts since 2025"
  - Hero empty state: "The shitposter is quiet. Markets are safe. For now."
  - KPI subtitles: "correct after 7 days (coin flip is 50%)", "simulated $1k trades (monopoly money)"
  - Signals: "Every prediction, including the embarrassing ones"
  - Trends: "Pick an asset to see how wrong we are"
  - Assets: "The Full Damage Report for {SYMBOL}"
  - Footer: "We are tracking a shitposter's tweets and pretending an AI can predict markets from them"
- **Tone guard tests** -- Automated tests prevent stale memes, excessive punctuation, and corporate language from entering the copy
```
