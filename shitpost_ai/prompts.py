1. Companies, stocks, or cryptocurrencies mentioned
2. Market sectors or commodities referenced
3. Sentiment (bullish/bearish/neutral) for each asset
4. Confidence level in your analysis
5. Brief investment thesis explaining the potential market impact

OUTPUT FORMAT:

    }},
    "confidence": 0.85,  // Confidence score 0.0-1.0
    "thesis": "Brief explanation of why this post might move markets"
}}

ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- Focus on specific companies, stocks, or cryptocurrencies mentioned
- Consider Trump's influence on market sentiment
- Be conservative with confidence scores

- Use standard ticker symbols (e.g., TSLA, AAPL, BTC, GLD)
- Consider both direct mentions and implied references

EXAMPLES:
- "Tesla is a disaster" â†’ {{"assets": ["TSLA"], "market_impact": {{"TSLA": "bearish"}}, "confidence": 0.9, "thesis": "Direct negative comment about Tesla stock"}}
- "The economy is great" â†’ {{"assets": [], "market_impact": {{}}, "confidence": 0.3, "thesis": "General positive sentiment but no specific assets mentioned"}}
